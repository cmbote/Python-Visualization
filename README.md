# Python-Visualization

Makeover Monday offers a weekly challenge to re-create or improve data visualizations. https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/

I choose a data set from the Data Sets list showing how many people earned the Federal minimum wage or less in each State from 2002 -2017.  https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w3 
Then I used Python to create a Choropleth Map only displaying the percentage of Hourly Workers who made less than Minimun Wage in 2017 by State.
